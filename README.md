# BlackOut Protocal
Making a game over summer before the start of uni again

# Game Ideas
Playing as a special unit in the military specially designed to deal with problems such as this one.
A Rouge Paramilitary Group *The Rouge Dawn* has taken over a small town *insert town name here* and has started producing a weapon that will cause mass disruption!

# Mission 1
Insertion & Recon

Land outside of the town (in a forested area) where the patrols are light take them out and head into the city outskirts.
Look through houses on the outskirts that can be used for a base and setup base.

Squad: Player + 2 AI

Location Forested Area -> City Outskirts

MISSION LAYOUT

1. Insertion
Drop in via truck. Briefing VO plays over comms.

Team is automatically following you; minimal player input required at this point.

Atmosphere: Foggy treeline, light rain, distant city skyline in view.

2. First Contact (Stealth Intro)
Encounter a small patrol (2–3 enemies) moving through the woods.

Choice:

Sneak around (tutorial prompt: “Use Hold to keep your team hidden”)

Ambush (teach synchronized fire or flanking)

3. Ruined Farmhouse
Optional intel pickup: radio log hinting at city lockdown.

First interior clear: single building with 2 enemies inside.

Let AI take point if commanded. Introduce “Breach” command (kick door, flashbang if you have one).

4. Safehouse
Reach the safehouse (a small reinforced house with a basement).

Once inside, team blocks entry points and sets up.

Player interacts with a laptop: pulls satellite photos, hears radio chatter about "The Rouge Dawn" movements.

Reveal: You’re now cut off from command — radio static takes over.
